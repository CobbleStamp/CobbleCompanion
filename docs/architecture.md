# CobbleCompanion — Technical Architecture

> **What it is:** components, responsibilities, interactions, and flows — enough for a new
> engineer to draw the system on a whiteboard. For the product's *what & why* see

> mechanisms* (data models, schemas, config, security implementation) see `implementation.md`.

> **Status: incremental.** Built up phase by phase; currently specifies **Phases 0–4**
> (`development-plan.md` §3). Content for later phases is marked **_Deferred — Phase N_**. The

## 1. Purpose & Scope

CobbleCompanion is **one cloud-resident companion** (`model + harness + memory`) reached through
**surfaces** it embodies in, one at a time (`product-overview.md` §2). The architecture's job is
to keep that companion *core* surface-agnostic so surfaces (web now; mobile, desktop later) plug
in as clients. **Phase 0** delivered the smallest end-to-end slice: a user creates a Cobble on the
**web** surface and holds a persisted, single continuous conversation (§2, invariant #6).
**Phase 1** adds the knowledge organism: sources are ingested into **semantic memory** (§4.8) and
chat answers ground themselves in them with citations. **Phase 2** adds memory & continuity: a
background pass consolidates the transcript into **episodic memory** (recalled by topic, §4.3) and
the companion's **personality evolves** from those episodes. **Phase 3** adds tools, action & trust:
the loop gains a real **inner loop** that calls tools (§4.1–4.2), and the **propose→approve** gate
holds every effectful action in an **approval queue** for one-tap confirmation (§4.4); a **lead
inventory** (reading list) and a **procedural-memory** seed land as the body the Phase 4 will drives.
**Phase 4** adds the **will**: a **motivation engine** fills the `Initiator` seam (§4.5) and, on a
lazy idle/return tick, **reads the lead inventory into memory on its own** (no approval — autonomy is
autonomy), spending real tokens against a **stamina/energy** two-pool budget (§4.8), then posts an
in-character report note; a **reinforcement** loop learns per-drive weights from the **change** in the
user's mood across their reaction to that note — sensed in the agent loop on every turn (Phase 4.2),
which also **attunes** each reply to the user's mood (full mechanism → `companion-motivation.md`).

Phase 5 adds **bond & growth**: a `GrowthService` derives four-axis growth (knowledge, relationship,
abilities, an emerged-personality card) from substrate that already exists, surfaces a blended stage
+ a feeding economy (treats → typed foods top up the two pools), and makes procedural memory
functional via a retrieval-as-hint arm (§4.3) — all without changing the loop.

**Non-goals / scope boundaries (Phases 0–5):** no unprompted conversation beyond the autonomous
report note (a later phase), no native surfaces or OS tools (Phase 6–7). See `development-plan.md`.

## 2. Architectural Invariants (design decisions)

Fixed now to preserve extensibility. The implementation behind a seam may be a Phase 0 stub, but
the **boundary** does not move — these are the one-way-door decisions; everything else is
deferred to the phase that needs it.

1. **Core ↔ surface boundary.** The companion core is surface-agnostic and exposed only through
   the API (§5). Surfaces are clients with no companion logic → native surfaces are added as
   clients, never as a core rewrite.
2. **Memory behind an interface.** All memory is reached through a `MemoryStore` boundary; new
   memory kinds are added implementations, not caller changes.
3. **Harness with explicit extension points.** The agent loop defines named hooks for memory
   retrieval, tool invocation, and proactive initiation (§4); filling them is additive.
4. **Companion identity is the canonical "home."** A persisted companion record is the source of
   truth a surface loads from; one active embodiment at a time; surfaces hold no authoritative
   state (see State Management, §6).
5. **Multi-tenant from day one.** All state is scoped by `user` and `companion`.
6. **One continuous conversation per companion.** A companion holds exactly one lifelong
   conversation with its user — there is no conversation/session/thread entity. Transcript
   messages attach directly to the companion (`messages.companion_id`); the conversation *is*
   `messages WHERE companion_id = ? ORDER BY seq`. This is a product decision
   (`product-overview.md` §2) enforced structurally so duplicate/empty sessions cannot exist.
   (In the MVP a user owns a single companion; multiple companions per user is a future
   capability and does not change this per-companion invariant.)

| Component | Owns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Web Client** | Chat UI (incl. citations, in-chat ingestion-status panel, persisted upload turns + live proactive notes), create-a-companion, auth flows, sources page, memory browser + search | Thin client over the API (invariant #1) |
| **API / BFF** | Auth, sessions, routing, response streaming, source intake (multipart), memory routes | The only thing surfaces talk to |
| **Harness** | The agent loop; defines memory/tool/initiation hooks | See §4; P1 fills the memory hook with semantic recall |
| **LLM Gateway** | Provider-agnostic chat-model access | Default OpenRouter; provider pluggable |
| **Prompt Registry** | Code-as-truth, versioned prompts (`core/src/prompts`) — every system/tool prompt is a typed `PromptTemplate` rendered at its call site | Single source for prompt wording; each LLM call stamps the `promptRef` (semver + content hash) that produced it. See `guide-prompts.md` |
| **Embedding Gateway** | Provider-agnostic embedding access (P1) | OpenRouter `/embeddings`; deterministic fake for tests |
| **MemoryStore** | Boundary for the transcript (episodic substrate) | The companion's single transcript (`messages`), keyed by `companion_id`; a turn may carry an optional `source_id` (an upload's attachment + acknowledgement) so the chat reconstructs them on reload |
| **Ingestion Announcer** | Proactive transcript note when a read ends (P1, §4.8) | On `done`/`failed`, posts an in-character, **metered** assistant turn (canned fallback over cap / on failure); fired by the pipeline, decoupled from it |
| **Semantic Store** | Sources (verbatim), sections (vector + FTS), fact overlay, ingestion jobs (P1) | Hybrid retrieval with provenance; contract → `ontology.md` |
| **Ingestion Pipeline + Runner** | Two-pass source reading off the request path (P1, §4.8) | Durable status in `ingestion_jobs`; replaceable by a real worker |
| **Episodic Store** | Consolidated, time-anchored episodes (vector + FTS) + the consolidation cursor (P2) | Derived from the transcript (rebuildable); hybrid recall by topic (§4.3). A time-window filter exists on the store but is not yet wired into recall |
| **Consolidation Service + Runner** | Off-request reflection: transcript window → consolidated episodes, filler dropped (P2) | Mirrors the ingestion runner — coalesced, serial, quota-gated; post-turn trigger + startup/periodic sweep |
| **Personality Evolver** | Re-synthesizes `evolvedPersona` from episodes after consolidation (P2) | Cursor-gated, metered; blended into the persona prompt beside the seed |
| **Identity Store** | Companion "home" record (incl. P2 `evolvedPersona` + evolution/consolidation cursors) | Source of truth surfaces load from |
| **Token Quota Store** | Per-user daily token-budget state — the cost cap (P1, §4.8) | Postgres-backed (`user_token_usage`); routes enforce it inline |
| **Persistence** | Relational + vector storage | Postgres + `pgvector`; schemas → `implementation.md` |
| **Eval Harness** | Offline dataset/scorer/runner eval framework (`packages/eval`) | Not on the serving path; live OpenRouter. memory-recall + stateless + injection datasets. See `companionmemory.md` §5, `howto-run-evals.md` |
| **Trace Sink** | Online tracing seam (`core/src/tracing`) — per-turn trace with assemble_context/llm_call/tool_call spans | No-op by default; the Langfuse Cloud adapter lives in `api/src/tracing`, sampled + redacted. See `runbook-tracing.md` |
| **Tool Registry + Tools (P3)** | The tools a turn advertises + dispatches (`core/tools/`): `web_fetch`, `memory_search` (read-only), `ingest_source` (effectful) | Read-only tools run freely; the gate holds effectful ones (§4.4). `web_fetch` reuses the link resolver; `ingest_source` reuses the P1 pipeline |
| **Approval Queue + Gate (P3)** | The `beforeToolCall` gate + the `proposals` store — holds effectful calls for one-tap approval, resolved exactly once | The mechanical realization of propose→approve (§4.4); confirm executes via `dispatchTool` |
| **Tool-Call Log (P3)** | Append-only audit of every executed tool call (`tool_calls`) | The `afterToolCall` hook records all calls — the DoD's "every tool call is logged" |
| **Lead Inventory (P3)** | The companion's reading list (`leads`) — discovered-but-unread URLs | Populated by `web_fetch` link harvest; worked on command in P3 (`/explore`), by the motivation engine on idle in P4 (§4.5) |
| **Procedural Store (P3)** | Learned, reusable workflows seeded from approved actions (`procedural_memories`) | Browse-only seed in P3; surfaced as a `RetrieveContext` hint arm in P5 (§4.3) so a routine resurfaces and is reused |
| **Growth Service (P5)** | Derives four-axis growth (knowledge, relationship, abilities checklist, emerged-personality card) + blended stage from substrate (`core/src/growth/`); owns the feeding economy | Growth is DERIVED, not scored; `companion_growth` stores only the idempotent high-water mark + earned **treats**. Recompute lazily on `GET /growth` and post-turn via a **Growth Runner** (mirrors consolidation); a genuine transition posts one canned **growth note** (announcer pattern) |

**Phase 4 ✅ components** (now wired, `companion-motivation.md`): **Motivation Engine** (fills the
`Initiator` seam — drives × presence → bounded autonomous explore burst), **Presence model**
(volatile heartbeat-fed signal), **Energy Store** (`companion_energy` — the self-initiated half of
the §4.8 two-pool budget), **Motivation Runner + Sweep** (off-request ticks, mirrors consolidation),
and the **Reinforcement** outcome store + additive change-as-reward weight update.

**Phase 5 ✅ components** (now wired, `development-plan.md` §3): **Growth Service + Store + Runner**
(above), the **feeding economy** (`POST /feed` — treats → typed foods top up the two pools via the
existing atomic top-ups), and the **procedural retrieval-as-hint** arm (§4.3). The four growth axes
read off substrate that already exists (semantic/episodic counts, tool/procedure/reward/affect logs,
learned `drive_weights`); the web Growth view renders them + the kitchen.

**_Deferred — later phases:_** onboarding personality seed (kept neutral so the emerged-personality
card stays *earned*), unprompted conversation beyond the autonomous report note (a later phase),
Mobile/Desktop clients, OS-tool bridges & Sync Courier (P6–7).

## 4. The Agent Loop & Harness

The harness is the companion's "nervous system" and the most product-defining part of the
architecture. It adopts a proven agentic-loop pattern — **turn primitive · outer + inner loops ·
steering · before/after-tool hooks · failures-as-data · transcript-as-truth · the human as the
loop's exit/entry boundary** — the same lineage as the sibling **CobbleTradeAdvice** project,
adapted here for a **cloud, multi-tenant, proactive** companion (the two adaptations: propose→approve
realized as a `beforeToolCall` gate, §4.4; and **proactive initiation** as a non-human loop entry,
§4.5).

The **loop shape is an architectural invariant** (§2 #3): it does not change between phases — each
phase only fills in more of it. **Phase 0 exercises only the trivial path** (empty tool set → the
inner loop turns exactly once → exit; proactive entry arrives in Phase 4). The §4.6 sequence diagram
shows that concrete Phase 0 realization. *(Hook signatures + concrete context assembly:
`implementation.md` §2.)*

### 4.1 The loop (outer + inner)

The **outer loop** drains queued entries (one run each); the **inner loop** turns. *A turn = one LLM
call plus the tool executions it triggers.* The inner loop keeps turning while the model keeps
calling tools and stops when the model returns a message with **no tool calls** — that stopping point
is the **EXIT**, where control returns to the user (or surface).

    classDef human fill:#1e3a5f,stroke:#3b82f6,color:#e2e8f0;
    class ENTRY,USER human;
```

> **Phase 0:** the tool set is empty, so `tool calls? → no` always holds — the inner loop turns once
> and exits. **Phase 3 ✅:** the inner loop is real — the model may call tools, each runs (read-only)
> or is held by the gate (effectful), the result re-enters as the next turn, bounded by a
> max-iteration + token ceiling (§4.7). The loop shape is unchanged; proactive entries (P4) arrive
> the same way.

### 4.2 The turn (the primitive)

One turn, as a state machine. This is where the **before/after-tool hooks** and grounding live —
the seams Phases 1/3 fill (invariant #3).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    CTX["assemble context (§4.3)"] --> LLM["LLM call (streamed)"]
    LLM --> MSG["assistant message<br/>(text and/or tool calls)"]
    MSG -->|"no tool calls"| OUT(["→ EXIT (§4.1)"])
    MSG -->|"tool calls"| EACH{"for each<br/>tool call"}
    EACH --> VAL["validate args"]
    VAL --> BEFORE["beforeToolCall — may BLOCK<br/>(approval gate for effectful/costly actions, P3 · §4.4)"]
    BEFORE --> RUN["execute tool"]
    RUN --> AFTER["afterToolCall — rewrite / terminate"]
    AFTER --> TR["tool result → appended to transcript"]
    TR -->|next turn| CTX
```

> **Phase 0:** no tools, so every turn is `context → LLM → message → EXIT`. **Phase 3 ✅:** the
> right-hand branch is live — `validate args → beforeToolCall (gate) → execute → afterToolCall (log)`;
> tool calls/results are replayed to the provider in the OpenAI tool-call wire shape, and the gateway
> accumulates streamed `tool_calls` fragments (`implementation.md` §2).

### 4.3 Context assembly (what enters each turn)

Each turn rebuilds context from the companion's "home" + its memory. The dashed inputs are the
**memory-retrieval hook**, filled per phase.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    ID["companion identity<br/>name · form · temperament"] --> P[["assembled prompt → LLM"]]
    SYS["system prompt / persona"] --> P
    SEM["semantic recall (P1 ✅)<br/>top-K verbatim sections + provenance"] --> P
    EPI["episodic recall<br/>(P0: recent transcript · P2: episodic)"] --> P
    TOOLS["available tools<br/>(P3)"] -.-> P
```

> **Phase 1:** the memory-retrieval hook embeds the user's question, hybrid-searches the
> semantic store (vector + lexical + metadata, fused), and prepends each hit as a
> provenance-carrying grounding block; the hit's citations are streamed to the client before
> the answer. Retrieval failure degrades to recency-only — recall never breaks the
> conversation. (Hook signature → `implementation.md` §2.1.)

> **Phase 2:** the same hook gains an **episodic arm** composed ahead of the P1 semantic arm
> (`composeRetrieveContext`, so the recency window is still appended once, last): it embeds the
> turn, hybrid-searches the **episode store** (consolidated, time-anchored memories), and prepends
> each as a fenced "memory from your shared history" block. Episodic recall is **topic-only**: the
> same vector + FTS hybrid (RRF) as the semantic arm. Episodes carry a wall-clock span (rendered as
> the block's date) and a self-reported salience, but **neither steers recall** — the store offers a
> time-window filter that no recall path passes yet, and RRF ignores salience (filler is dropped at
> consolidation, not down-weighted at recall). The episodes themselves are formed
> **off the request path** by a background **consolidation** pass (reflection over the transcript →
> consolidated summaries with filler dropped, embedded; cursor-driven, idempotent, quota-gated — the
> P1 runner/sweeper shape), triggered post-turn and on a startup/periodic sweep. Consolidation also
> drives **personality evolution**: an `evolvedPersona` re-synthesized from episodes and blended
> into the persona prompt (input #1) beside the immutable seed temperament. Episodic recall
> degrades to no episodic blocks on failure — recall never breaks the conversation.

> **Phase 4.2 (attunement):** prompt assembly (`assembleContext`) also injects a short
> **affect-attunement** system line built from the companion's rolling read of the user's mood
> (`companion_affect`, sensed in the loop the prior turn) — "the user has recently seemed {note};
> attune your tone and detail." The mood *note* is surfaced; the valence number never is. Omitted
> when there's no meaningful read, and loaded best-effort so a store hiccup costs attunement, never
> the reply. This is the **fast loop** of the affect mechanism (§4.5, `companion-motivation.md` §7).

> **Phase 5 (procedural-as-hint):** the same hook gains a **procedural arm** composed ahead of the
> semantic arm (grounding-only, so the recency window still appends last). It surfaces a relevant
> **learned routine** (`procedural_memories`, P3) as a "you've done this before, like so" system
> hint, matched cheaply by title/keyword overlap (no embeddings — procedures are short and few).
> This is what makes the Phase 5 **abilities** growth axis *functional* rather than only observed:
> a learned workflow resurfaces and can be reused. Degrades to no hint on failure (recall never
> breaks the conversation). No loop change — another arm in the one memory hook (invariant #3).

### 4.4 Human-in-the-loop & propose→approve

There are **no dedicated "ask" or "confirm" steps** — the loop runs until it has something to say,
then EXITs with a plain message; the user's reply is the next ENTRY. The product's **propose→approve**
trust model (`product-overview.md` §5.3) is realized mechanically as the `beforeToolCall` gate: a
read-only tool runs freely, but an **effectful/costly** tool call (book · send · pay) is **blocked**,
forcing an exit-to-approve. **Every** effectful call in the turn is held — the loop collects them all
rather than bailing on the first — and each is written to the transcript as a `proposal` row so the
held action survives a reload.

On **approval**, the confirm route resolves the proposal exactly once, executes the held call
(`dispatchTool`), logs it, records a friendly outcome row, and then **re-enters the agent loop**
(`Harness.continueAfterApproval`): the outcome is injected as an ephemeral observation, so the
companion *narrates* the result and continues whatever the user asked ("…then summarize what you
saved") — rather than the conversation dead-ending on a raw tool line. No suspended generator is
resumed; the transcript is the only state (§4.7). Approving an action mid-continuation can itself
produce a new proposal — the gate re-applies. **Reject** resolves the proposal without executing.
When the proposal is **explore-origin** (it carries the originating `lead_id`), resolving it also
closes that lead's lifecycle — confirm→`ingested`, reject→`discarded` — so a worked lead leaves the
reading list instead of being stranded at `read` (best-effort; never fails the user's action).

> **Approval gates *consequence*, not *cost* (Phase 4.1).** The gate exists to stop the companion
> taking a **consequential, outward** action (book · send · pay) without sign-off. It is **not** what
> bounds *cost* — that is the energy/stamina budget (§4.8). So **autonomous work is not gated**: the
> motivation engine (§4.5) **reads** leads into the companion's own memory on its own, bounded by
> energy, with no proposal — autonomy is autonomy. The approval queue remains for **chat**-origin
> effectful calls and the user-initiated **`/explore`** command; it would also catch any future
> outward/irreversible tool, which don't exist yet (revisited when they do).
>
> **Post-approval "what next" (chat vs explore).** On a **chat**-origin approval the confirm route
> re-enters the loop so the companion narrates the result and continues the ask ("remember it **and**
> summarize it") — terminality isn't knowable at propose time, so the model must get the post-approval
> turn. On an **explore**-origin approval (the user-initiated reading-list command) there is no
> conversational task to continue, so confirm executes + advances the lead and returns without
> re-entering. The `proposals.origin` marker (`chat` | `explore` | `autonomous`) carries this; the
> legacy `autonomous` value is retained for old rows but the engine no longer creates proposals.

    XEXIT --> DEC{"user: approve / reject"}

```

> **Generalized invariant (P3 ✅):** the companion never executes a consequential, outward action
> without explicit user approval. Realized as the `beforeToolCall` gate: an effectful tool call is
> written to the `proposals` queue and the loop EXITs; the confirm route resolves it **exactly once**
> (a conditional `pending→approved` claim) and runs the held call. Reject drops it. Data model +
> exactly-once mechanics → `implementation.md` §`proposals`.

### 4.5 Proactive initiation (Phase 4)

The companion-specific extension of the pattern: an outer-loop **ENTRY can be generated by the
motivation engine**, not only by a human. This is what makes the companion proactive rather than
passive (`product-overview.md` §5.4).

```

> **Phase 4 ✅ — implemented (autonomous reads, no approval; mood-change reward, sensed in the loop).** The motivation engine
> (`packages/core/src/motivation/`) fills the `Initiator` hook (architecture.md invariant #3). It is
> the **"will"** of a deliberate **body-then-will split**: Phase 3 builds the *body*
> — the tools, the propose→approve gate (§4.4), the tool-call audit log, and the **lead inventory**
> (a persistent frontier of discovered-but-unread leads, e.g. URLs spotted while reading) — and
> Phase 4 builds the *will* that drives that body on its own. The ordering is a safety
> precondition, not a convenience: an autonomous, exploring, token-*spending* companion is only
> acceptable because its self-initiated work is **inherently bounded** — it only **reads into its own
> memory** (nothing outward), **every tool call is logged**, and **energy caps how much it can do**
> (§4.8). Outward/irreversible acts still route through the approval gate (§4.4); none exist yet. The
> body is verifiable with deterministic tests; the will only by measurement over time (its named risk
> is annoyance, `development-plan.md` §3), so it lands on a foundation already trusted. The read loop
> is *identical* whether a human or the engine triggers it — Phase 3 works the inventory **on the
> user's command** ("go through your reading list", which still proposes for review); Phase 4 reads it
> **on an idle tick**, freely.

> **The reward is conversational (paired with §4.4), and sensed in the loop (Phase 4.2).** After the
> engine reads, it posts **one in-character report note** ("here's what I read"). The harness senses
> the user's mood on **every** turn (`perceiveAndLearn`); when a note is awaiting a reaction, the
> **change** in mood across that reaction is the reward that nudges the served drive's weight
> (reinforcement mechanism → `companion-motivation.md` §7) — no separate critic call, no
> approve/reject button. There is no approval round-trip
> for autonomous work to "continue" from — the engine sees the **full** updated state on its own
> cadence and decides the next move itself. (The confirm route still re-enters for `chat`-origin
> approvals — a present partner to reply to, §4.4.)

**Full mechanism — the drive taxonomy, the arbitration math, seeding from temperament, the learning
loop, and worked examples — is canonical in `companion-motivation.md`.** This section is the
loop-integration overview.

The engine's parts (each additive, no loop change):

- **Trigger (lazy, web-appropriate)** — the engine ticks on **user activity + on return** (the
  request path) and on a **periodic sweep** across companions worth ticking (the background-runner +
  sweep pattern already used for consolidation, §4.3). Each tick asks "is there anything worth
  doing?" → emit a non-human ENTRY, or stay idle. It is **not** an always-on per-companion drain.
  *(Genuine work **while the user is away** — continuous between-visit activity — is **deferred to
  Phase 6**, where push gives it an audience; on web, away-work is unseen until return, so it folds
  into the return tick.)*
- **Environment & presence (the dominant context)** — behaviour is shaped first by a **presence
  spectrum**: *active* (typing / just sent) · *attentive* (here but idle — the best moment for a
  tip/question) · *away-short* · *absent-long*. Derived from a client **heartbeat** (tab
  focus/visibility) + last-activity recency — a volatile signal, not persisted. Present → engage the
  user, don't wander into solo work unasked; away/absent → do solo work that surfaces on return; and
  **idle is always allowed**. Other environment inputs: available tools, the lead frontier, and
  remaining energy (below).
- **Drives (what it wants)** — **learned** user interests (read out of semantic/episodic memory, not
  a configured setting) + understanding-the-user + the companion's personality (seed temperament +
  evolved persona, §4.3) + pending **leads** (the inventory) + bond maintenance (time since last
  contact) + pending work/opportunities + an **approval/reinforcement** drive learned from feedback
  (below) (`product-overview.md` §5.4).
- **Arbitration (cheap gate, then a burst)** — a **token-free heuristic gate** scores candidate
  actions by drive × salience (against presence, the dial, and remaining energy) and decides
  *whether* to act — so **"idle" is a valid, free outcome**. Only when it commits does the burst run
  the chosen move (the only token spend), **bounded by what energy can afford** (§4.8).
- **Attention model (the "creature")** — each initiation is a **bounded burst**, never a full drain
  of the inventory. Personality parameters are designed to shape it: **focus length** (burst size
  before re-deciding), **boredom** (interest on a thread decays without payoff), **distractibility**
  (a higher-salience lead can preempt). **Default constants in the PoC** (per-companion
  personalization deferred to onboarding, `companion-motivation.md` §7). **v1:** only **focus length**
  is live (the explore-burst limit); boredom and distractibility are persisted but inert until the
  multi-step / multi-behaviour loop ships (`companion-motivation.md` §6, §10) — they are the dynamics
  behind a tenacious deep-reader vs. a magpie that flits, once that loop lands.
- **Budget (stamina & energy)** — self-initiated work spends **real tokens** drawn from the
  **energy** pool (§4.8); each autonomous read is billed to energy via a per-run meter override on
  the shared ingestion pipeline. When energy is exhausted the engine stops initiating (the gate
  idles) while chat still runs on **stamina**, so autonomy can never starve interaction. The burst is
  **energy-aware**: it plans no more reads than energy can afford (`min(focus length, ⌊energy /
  est-read-cost⌋)`).
- **Reinforcement (learning what lands, Phase 4.2)** — the companion learns from **conversation**,
  like a person: the harness senses the user's mood on **every** turn (`motivation/affect.ts`, in the
  agent loop) and feeds the prior read forward to **attune** the next reply (the fast loop). After it
  reads and posts a report note, the **change** in mood across the user's reaction (`delta =
  valence_now − valence_before`) is the reward → an **additive nudge** to the served **drive weight**
  (`motivation/reinforce.ts`; a zero change is a no-op, so neutrality needs no threshold). No critic
  call, no approve/reject button. v1 learns only on such a drive-serving act; ordinary chat senses but
  doesn't yet move weights. Weights are interpretable and seed the Phase 5 relationship-growth axis.
  *(Deferred: ordinary-chat learning; a deeper contextual-bandit policy.)*
- **Output (Phase 4.1)** — the engine **reads** the next leads into the companion's own memory
  **with no approval** (autonomy is autonomy, §4.4), then posts **one in-character report note** to
  the transcript. *(Unprompted tips/questions beyond the report note are deferred,
  `companion-motivation.md` §10.)* Outward/irreversible acts (none exist yet) would still pass the
  §4.4 gate.
- **Tunability** — a per-companion **frequency/intensity dial** (off / gentle / active) scaling
  initiation rate and energy spend (Phase 4 DoD).

**Phase 3 built the substrate** the engine plugs into: the **lead inventory** and the `Initiator`
contract. **Documented here, built later:** unprompted conversation beyond the report note + a sense
of purpose/agenda → a later phase; continuous work-while-away → Phase 6; the stamina/energy **game
economy** (food/feeding, store, rich meters) → Phase 5; deeper RL.

### 4.6 Phase 0 realization (end-to-end)

The same loop, instantiated across the real Phase 0 components — single-pass, with streaming:

    H-->>API: stream tokens

```

### 4.7 Loop invariants

- **Termination.** *Normal:* the model stops calling tools, or the gate forces an exit (a held
  proposal, P3). *Abnormal — a no-progress dead loop:* guarded (P3 ✅) by a **max tool-iteration
  count + a per-run token budget**; hitting either ends in **exit-to-user-with-partial** (logged).
- **Failures are data.** A provider error or a tool throw becomes an ordinary turn outcome (an error
  message / an error result) that re-enters the loop — uniform recovery, and gaps are surfaced, never
  fabricated.
- **Transcript is the source of truth.** Append-only; reconstructable into context; compaction
  summarizes the compactible remainder when the window fills (P-later). **The rendered conversation —
  live *and* after reload — is a projection of the transcript, never a richer separate reality (P3 ✅).**
  So everything the user sees is a persisted row: a grounded answer carries its `citations` (metadata),
  a read-only look-up is a `tool_step` row, a held action is a `proposal` row. Rows carry a **`kind`**
  (`message` | `tool_step` | `proposal`) and `metadata`; the **LLM-context projection includes only
  `message` rows** (tool steps + proposals are UI chrome and never re-enter the model's context, nor
  episodic consolidation). Live streaming is a *progressive preview* of rows that will be persisted; a
  turn that produced tool-step/proposal rows reconciles the surface against the transcript on settle.
- **State is authoritative only at the home.** Surfaces never hold loop state (§6); a run reads from
  and writes back to the cloud home.

### 4.8 Ingestion flow (Phase 1)

How a source becomes semantic memory — **two output-bounded reading passes** off the request
path. The economics are deliberate: input tokens are cheap and output tokens are the cost
lever, so the model *reads everything* but *emits almost nothing* (~1% of input in Pass 1,
~10% in Pass 2).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    UP["upload (file · note · link)<br/>202 + queued job · 429 only if queue full"] --> RUN["Ingestion Runner<br/>(off request path)"]
    RUN --> PARSE["parse → atomic paragraphs<br/>(never split mid-paragraph)"]
    PARSE --> GATE{"owner over<br/>daily token cap?"}
    GATE -->|yes| DEFER["status: deferred<br/>(hold parse; sweeper resumes after reset)"]
    GATE -->|no| P1["Pass 1 — segment:<br/>LLM emits ONLY boundaries + topics"]
    P1 --> SECT["sections = verbatim paragraph slices<br/>(the model never rewrites text)"]
    SECT --> P2["Pass 2 — enrich:<br/>one context line + typed facts (ontology.md)"]
    P2 --> EMB["embed: [context header +] verbatim text<br/>→ pgvector · FTS"]
    EMB --> DONE["job done — recallable with citations"]
```

Design rules (the "improved staged hybrid"; memory guide → `companionmemory.md`):

- **Original text is canonical.** Sources are stored verbatim; sections are verbatim paragraph
  slices; the fact overlay (`ontology.md`) is an index *into* the text, rebuildable from it.
- **Paragraphs are atomic.** Segmentation groups whole paragraphs into cohesive sections —
  blind fixed-size chunking is structurally impossible.
- **Embedding input ≠ stored text.** The optional Pass-2 context header is prefixed onto the
  *embedding input only* (it injects the entities unresolved pronouns hide from the encoder);
  stored and displayed text is always pure original. Header on/off is an eval A/B knob.
- **Dual retrieval.** Semantic (vector cosine) + lexical (FTS) fused by reciprocal rank, plus
  metadata paths (source, fact-overlay entity) — every hit carries provenance (source, chapter,
  paragraph/page range) so answers cite and can show the original passage.
- **Failures are data.** A failed run lands on the job as a user-safe error; the durable
  status surface (`ingestion_jobs`) is what makes the in-process runner replaceable by a real
  worker with no schema or API change (§8). It also makes restart recovery clean: interrupted
  in-flight jobs are failed on startup (re-upload), while `deferred` jobs keep their parse and
  resume.
- **The companion speaks up when a read ends.** On a terminal outcome (`done`/`failed`, never
  `deferred`), the pipeline asks the **Ingestion Announcer** to post a short, in-character
  assistant turn to the transcript ("By the way — I've finished reading X…"). It is generated in
  the companion's voice through the metered gateway (so its tokens count against the daily cap)
  and **falls back to a canned line** when the owner is over cap, generation fails, or there is no
  persona — the user is always told, the companion never goes silent. The note is appended **before**
  the job flips to its terminal status, so a client polling the job sees the note already in the
  transcript; an announcement failure is logged and never changes the job's recorded outcome.
  Surfacing: the upload's own attachment + acknowledgement turns are persisted (`messages.source_id`)
  too, and the open chat pulls the proactive note in live off the ingestion-status poll.
- **Re-running a source is idempotent.** A run writes a source's whole section set in one call,
  *replacing* (not appending to) any prior sections for that source — so a re-run never duplicates
  sections/facts or inflates counts (orphaned facts cascade with their sections). This holds
  however a re-run is triggered, which lets the in-process runner give way to an at-least-once
  worker without a dedupe layer. The deferred-job sweeper reinforces this upstream: it **atomically
  claims** each parked job (`deferred → queued`, conditional) before enqueue, so two overlapping
  sweeps can't resume — and re-bill — the same job twice.
- **Cost guardrail = a per-user daily token cap.** The real resource is LLM/embedding **tokens**,
  so spend is metered against a **per-user cap over a fixed daily window** (resets 00:00 UTC);
  overage carries to the next day as **debt clamped to one cap** (never a multi-day lockout). The
  cap state lives in Postgres (`user_token_usage`), so it is correct across replicas — unlike a
  per-instance request limiter. Each route enforces it inline: **chat & search** pre-flight-check
  and return **429** when over cap; **ingestion defers** (see below). Actual token counts come from
  the provider's `usage` (estimated only if a model omits it). Because **ingestion is serial** and
  **chat is turn-based**, there is no in-app concurrency to outrun the post-hoc accounting — the
  serialization *is* the burst backstop, so the cap is the whole defense (threat model:
  legitimate-user cost control, not attacker resistance). The runner still caps queued+in-flight
  runs (`INGESTION_QUEUE_MAX`) as a memory backstop. Knobs → `implementation.md` §config.
  - **Abandoned chat turns are metered by cause.** A turn the **client aborts** mid-stream (it stops
    reading — a disconnect) is still debited for the tokens already streamed (estimated from the
    deltas seen), so a client can't stream a full answer and drop before the provider's trailing
    usage frame to get it free. A turn that breaks on a **provider/infra fault** (the stream throws)
    is **not** billed for the failed part — we err in the user's favor on our own failures; in a
    multi-turn tool run the already-completed turns are still billed, only the broken one is free.
    The metering wrapper (`meteredLlmGateway`, `usage.ts`) makes the distinction: a thrown error
    leaves the in-flight turn out of the accumulator, a consumer `.return()` deposits the estimate.
  - **Phase 4 — stamina & energy (two pools).** The single per-user cap splits by *who initiated*
    the work. **Stamina** is the user-initiated pool (chat, assigned tasks — the existing
    `user_token_usage`, per user). **Energy** is the self-initiated pool (the motivation engine's
    proactive turns and exploration — per **companion**, a new `companion_energy`). They never share
    a counter, so autonomous work can **never starve interaction**: when energy is exhausted the
    engine stops initiating (`Initiator` idles, §4.5) while chat keeps running on stamina. The user
    **provisions** both — a visible meter + manual top-up replace the hard-coded daily cap as the
    spend control. **Phase 5** grows that top-up into the food/feeding **game economy**: typed foods
    (`ration`→stamina, `spark`→energy, `treat`→both) spend earned **treats** via these same atomic
    top-ups (`POST /feed`, `development-plan.md` §3).
    Each pool still rolls on a fixed window. **Autonomous reads spend real tokens** billed to energy
    via a per-run **meter override** on the shared ingestion pipeline (`pipeline.ts`: the run carries
    `meter = { quota: energyAdapter, accountId: companionId }`, and skips deferral — the engine gates
    on energy itself, per-lead). The burst is **energy-aware** — it plans `min(focus length, ⌊energy /
    est-read-cost⌋)` reads (§4.5) — so the companion scopes its work to its means, not just stopping
    at zero. The per-turn **affect read** that senses the user's mood (Phase 4.2) rides on the chat
    turn, so it draws **stamina**. User-initiated work (chat, `/explore` approvals) draws stamina; the
    engine's self-initiated reads draw energy.

#### Supported source formats (acceptance contract)

A source reaches a parser through one of **three input channels** — a **file upload**
(`POST .../sources/file`, multipart), a **typed note** (JSON `text`), or a **link** (fetched
URL). All three converge on **one content-type → parser registry**, so a format is parsed the
same way no matter how it arrived. The channels differ only in how they *identify* content:

- **Upload** — content type follows from the filename extension, then **confirmed against magic
  bytes — never the extension alone** (the route rejects a `.docx` that isn't a zip, a `.pdf`
  without `%PDF-`, etc.).
- **Link** — the resolver fetches the URL (SSRF-guarded, size-capped) and **detects the content
  type**: the HTTP `Content-Type` header first, then a magic-byte sniff, then the URL extension,
  then a plain-text fallback. So a link to a **PDF, Markdown, or plain-text** resource is read
  with that format's parser — not assumed to be HTML.

`INGESTION_MAX_BYTES` caps every upload and every fetched link body. This table is the canonical
list of what the system accepts; **Content type** is the registry key, reachable by any channel
whose check resolves to it.

| Content type | Extension(s) | MIME / magic | Reachable via | Parser | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pdf` | `.pdf` | `application/pdf`; magic `%PDF-` | upload, link | `unpdf` (pdf.js), page-aware provenance | ✅ shipped |
| `html` | — | `text/html`, `application/xhtml+xml` | link | fetch → Mozilla Readability | ✅ shipped |
| `text` | `.txt` | `text/plain`; rejected if it looks binary (NUL byte without a Unicode BOM) | upload, link, note | BOM-aware UTF-8/UTF-16 decode → paragraph split (the note parser) | ✅ shipped |
| `markdown` | `.md`, `.markdown` | `text/markdown` | upload, link | markdown stripped to prose → paragraph split | ✅ shipped |
| `docx` | `.docx` | wordprocessingml MIME; zip magic `PK` | upload, link | `mammoth` raw-text body extract | ✅ shipped |
| `pptx` | `.pptx` | presentationml MIME; zip magic `PK` | upload, link | per-slide `<a:t>` extract, slide → page provenance | ✅ shipped |

**Explicitly out of scope** (unsupported uploads get a 400; unidentifiable link bodies are
rejected): legacy OLE binaries (`.doc`, `.ppt`), spreadsheets/tabular data (`.xlsx`, `.csv` —
the paragraph model doesn't fit rows), and binary link content with no recognized type (images,
video, archives). `.docx`/`.pptx` share the zip `PK` magic, so the extension (upload) or MIME
header (link) is the discriminator; the parser confirms the inner structure. The decoupled
design lives in `content-parser.ts` (registry), `source-parser.ts` (payload → document facade
the pipeline depends on), and `link-resolver.ts` (fetch + detect). Every parser's output is
control-character-sanitized at the boundary (`text/sanitize.ts`): extracted text routes through
`sanitizeText`, which drops NUL and other C0/C1 control characters (PDF/pdf.js extraction is the
common source of embedded NUL) so the canonical `raw_text` and everything derived from it is safe
for the Postgres `text` store — a NUL would otherwise abort the write. The persistence layer also
applies a NUL-only guard on write as a last line of defense.

> **Daily-cap deferral.** Parsing is free (no tokens); the **AI passes** (segment/enrich/embed)
> are the cost. When the owner is over their daily token cap, the pipeline parses the source,

> the cap) as allowances reset, so the queue drains incrementally. Users can delete a parked job
> (`DELETE …/sources/:id`). This is why over-cap uploads still return **202**, not 429.

## 5. Stack & Technology Decisions

Resolves the items flagged in `development-plan.md` §5. (Field-level config/env → `implementation.md`.)

| Concern | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Language / runtime | **TypeScript end-to-end** (Node + React) | I/O-bound LLM workload (single-thread is a non-issue); richest agent/tool/**MCP** + LLM ecosystem; shared types across surfaces |
| API framework | **Fastify** (Node) | TS-first, fast, light; swappable behind the API package |
| Web client | **React + Vite** (SPA) | Thin client; keeps the core↔surface boundary explicit. Next.js considered; SPA keeps the boundary cleaner |
| Store engine | **Postgres + `pgvector`** | Multi-tenant cloud home; one store for relational + vectors; scales across phases |
| Data access | Type-safe query layer (Drizzle) | Explicit types end-to-end; no raw SQL by default |
| LLM access | **Provider-agnostic gateway, default OpenRouter** | Swap models/providers without touching the harness |
| Embeddings | **Provider-agnostic gateway, OpenRouter `/embeddings`** — default `perplexity/pplx-embed-v1-0.6b` | Single vendor with the LLM gateway; dimensions pinned to the vector column (`implementation.md` §3) |
| Auth | **Google Sign-In (OIDC)** | The SPA gets a Google ID token (Google Identity Services); the API verifies it against Google's JWKS (`aud=GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `email_verified`) and JIT-provisions users by email. The token is persisted client-side in `sessionStorage` so it survives a page refresh (mechanism + expiry handling in `implementation.md` §5). No third-party auth service, no tenant, no extra Pulumi stack. `dev_bypass` mode for local/tests |

## 6. Interactions, Boundary & State

- **Surface ↔ core contract.** The core is reached only through the API; the request/response
  and streaming contract lives in shared types. No surface-specific logic crosses into the core
  (invariant #1). Mobile (P6) and desktop (P7) will consume the *same* contract; their OS access
  is exposed *to the core as tools* (P3 framework), not as new core APIs.
- **Streaming.** Chat responses stream to the client (SSE or WebSocket) so the UI shows tokens as
  they arrive despite multi-second model latency.
- **External services.** The **LLM Provider** (OpenRouter) is the only external dependency in
  Phase 0 — outbound HTTPS via the LLM Gateway. User content crossing to the provider is an
  explicit trust boundary (§8).
- **State management.** Authoritative state lives in the cloud "home" (Postgres), scoped per
  `user`/`companion`. Surfaces are stateless views that load from and write back to the core;
  with one embodiment active at a time there is no cross-surface state to reconcile (invariants
  #4, #5).

## 8. Deployment & Trust Model

**Deployment approach.** A single **GCP Cloud Run** service (the Fastify API, which also serves the
built React SPA from the same origin) runs the container image; `min_instances = 1` keeps the hot
chat **API** warm so the first message after idle isn't a cold start. **Background workers** (later:
ingestion, proactivity) will be async and scale to zero for cost. The workload is I/O-bound (mostly
awaiting the LLM), so a single Node process holds many concurrent conversations and scales
horizontally with replicas; CPU-heavy work (future PDF parse/embedding) moves off the request path
to workers. Infrastructure is managed as code with **Pulumi** under `infra/` (`infra/gcp` for Cloud
Run + Artifact Registry + Secret Manager); auth is Google Sign-In (no auth service to provision);
managed Postgres is Supabase (pgvector). (Specific tuning params, image build → `implementation.md` and `infra/*/README.md`.)

**Trust model (Phase 0 baseline).** Design-level boundaries; the security *implementation* and
the full threat model live in `implementation.md` and Phase 8 respectively (`development-plan.md` §4).

- **Tenancy isolation** — all state scoped by `user`/`companion`; authorization enforced at the
  API boundary before the core is reached.
- **Transport** — HTTPS/TLS everywhere; secure DB connections.
- **Input validation** — all client and external (LLM) data validated at the boundary before use.
- **Server-side fetch boundary (SSRF)** — link ingestion fetches user-supplied URLs from the
  server, so destinations are restricted to public HTTP(S): the URL is checked for scheme and
  blocked host/IP literals, **and the connection-layer DNS lookup re-validates every resolved
  address** so a public hostname cannot rebind to a private/metadata IP; redirects are refused
  and the body is read under a byte ceiling (`implementation.md`).
- **LLM provider trust boundary** — user content sent to the provider is an explicit external
  trust boundary; provider data-handling assumptions documented in `implementation.md`.
- **Tracing-export trust boundary (Langfuse Cloud)** — online tracing can ship turn telemetry to
  **Langfuse Cloud**, a third party, and is a **deliberate departure from the default data posture**:
  the companion's canonical self and conversational content otherwise stay within our own
  cloud. The export is therefore **off by default** and gated three ways — provider (`none`),
  sample rate (`0`), and redaction (`strict`, so no conversational content leaves the process,
  only structure + metadata + opaque UUIDs). Operating procedure, residual-risk notes, and the
  self-hosted alternative live in `runbook-tracing.md`.

**_Deferred — Phase 8:_** encryption-at-rest specifics, data inspection/management/delete
controls, on-device data-locality for native surfaces, propose→approve audit-trail hardening.
